  Hi there! My name is Juliana Viola, and I'm currently a Software Engineer at Google based out of Cambridge, MA.

  Outside of work, I like reading, listening to podcasts, cooking vegetarian food, doing Peloton rides, cross-stitching,
  and watching gymnastics. I'm passionate about education, mental health, and diversity in tech.
  Currently I'm trying to learn as much as I can about product management.
